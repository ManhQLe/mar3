# Overview of MoSyRe architecture

MoSyRe is a shorthand notation for **M**odularity, **S**ynchronicity and **R**eactiveness, commonly-seen attributes of all things in existence including software architecture. MoSyRe is a name (I made up) of software architecture which is designed to express such attributes .This type of architecture can facilitate communication and synchronicity between individuals in a coherent manner. Such that any change occurs in the connection/network, can be conveyed properly to where it is needed.

This architecture expreses the fundametal principle of **Change**

> One change leads to other changes.

## Fundametal Definition
### Crystalization

> Crystalization in this context means, being in agreement to accept rules, conditions, or parameters to play a specific role or to function in a particular way. Crystalization process helps define and mold clay to have attributes/properties.  

### Clay

> A clay, as the name suggests, has no shape, no specific feature and is unfathomable. Its main quality is to connect and is capable of express/vibrate core frequency of itself ONCE being crystalized/went through crystalization process AND being in connection with other clays.

### Attribute Clay

> Attribute Clay is a clay being crystalized to have properties, features and/or parameters. This type of clay can retain such properties/features and can change/replace those by ifself at will.

### Behavioral Clay

> Behavioral Clay is Attribute Clay, which can **response** to vibration/signal being received from connections. Reponse and react are main behaviors of this crystalized clay. Its reponse and react can vary based on the agreement it has through parameters and properties accepted in crystalization process.

### Conduit

> Conduit is Behavioral Clay, its main function is to act as a link/bridge. Its **response** ability is to facilitate the connections and signal transmissions between clays. Once it picks up on a vibration from clay. This vibration will be replicated and reproduced on the network. Any clay connects to the same network can pick up on this vibration.
