# Overview of MoSyRe architecture

MoSyRe is a shorthand notation for **M**odularity, **S**ynchronicity and **R**eativeness, commonly-seen properties of modern software architecture. This architecture is designed to facilitate synchronicity between individual members in a coherent manner. Such that any change occurs in the connection/network, can be conveyed properly to where it is needed.

This architecture expreses the fundametal principle of **Change**

> One change leads to other changes.
